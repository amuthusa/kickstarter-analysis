# An analysis on Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Based on category based analysis Theatre campaigns had fair success compared to failures, please see the attached chart ![Parent Category Outcomes.png](images/Parent%20Category%20Outcomes.png)

Also Theatre category had more success on May, June, July months so I would recommend doing on those months for better success for Luise Fever play ![Outcomes based on Launch date](images/Outcomes Based%20on%20Launch%20Date.png
